Issue: Every subMap is creating a similar number of color
groups. I would expect the color groups to be more random.

To begin figuring out what is wrong, I will write the colors
in each subMap onto separate files. I will then compare the
files and make sure that nothing is being duplicated. 

Does it make sense for there to be duplicates? -> No.
The frequency map is populated in such a way that
duplicate colors are combined into a single key.
